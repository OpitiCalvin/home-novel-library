      "Thriller and Suspense go hand in hand, including scary elements like Horror. However, the objective is to maintain tension until the resolution.\nWhile they involve elements similar to the Mystery genre, the protagonist primarily attempts to save their own life, or someone elseâ€™s, rather than solving a crime."
